     Meadow Installation Manual
***************************************************************************

1. Caution

o You CANNOT share elc files (byte-compiled lisp files) with
  Meadow-3.XX and Meadow-1.XX.

2. Preparation

Meadow requires the following software.

2.1 ImageMagick

ImageMagick is a collection of tools and libraries to read, write, and
manipulate an image in many image formats. Currently Meadow supports
only ImageMagick-6.2.0, so you should install this without fail.

You can get these packages in the following URLs.

o ImageMagick

http://www.imagemagick.org/www/download.html

3. Installation

You can select installation methods, 3.1 or 3.2 subsection.

3.1 Installation of binary archive.

<STEP1: Extract the archive>

Please extract the archive of Meadow
There are following binary archives.

  Meadow-${VERSION}-i386.tar.gz	Intel x86 Binary

For example, a name of Meadow version 3.00 is "Meadow-3.00-i386.tar.gz".

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! You can extract the arvhie with tar.exe and gzip.exe.   !
! If you want to use the other archiver,                  !
! disable the feature of conversion LF into CR+LF.        !
! (Winzip enables this feature in the case of default.)   !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! DON'T install Meadow to the directory whose name contains non-ascii      !
! characters                                                               !
! and a white space. Maybe, you can install Meadow to such directories,    !
! but I don't verify its case.  Similarly, you should not specify your     !
! home directory named with non-ascii characters.                          !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you want to install the archive to "c:/win32app/Meadow",
please extract this at c:/win32app.

For example,
-----------------
c: [RETURN]
cd \win32app [RETURN]
tar zxvf Meadow-<VERSION>-<ARCHITECTURE>.tar.gz [RETURN]
-----------------

You can get the following tree.

c:/win32app/Meadow/
               +---- bin/              Main programs
               +---- bitmap/           splash bitmapfile
               +---- etc/              Other data
               +---- info/             info directory
               +---- leim/             leim directory
               +---- lisp/             Emacs Lisp library
               +---- site-lisp/        site-lisp Emacs Lisp library
               +---- README.Meadow.ja  
               +---- INSTALL.Meadow.ja 
               +---- dot.emacs.ja      sample of .emacs
               +---- install.exe

<STEP2: Execute install.exe>

Please execute "install.exe".

In the "Meadow" directory, you will find "install.exe".
It is an installtion program, please execute it.
(by an explorer, a command prompt, and so on.)

<STEP3: Specify your home directory>

The installation program asks you where your HOME DIRECTORY is.
Please input your HOME DIRECTORY.

;; FYI.
;; Your home directory is used for your personal space.
;; And you can put ".emacs" file here, then Meadow will read it.

That's all.  The installation program will install Meadow correctly.

You can invoke Meadow from the "Start" menu.
Its menu is stored in "Start -> Program -> Meadow -> Meadow".

3.2 Using Netinstaller

Currently, No netinstaller for Meadow 2.20 is available.

4. Installation of source archive.

Your compilation environment (Microsoft Visual C++ or Cygwin) make the
following procedures different.

4.1 With Microsoft Visual C++

<STEP1: Extract the archive>

Please extract the archive of Meadow

The source archive is named "Meadow-<VERSION>-src.tar.gz"
;; <VERSION> is the version name of Meadow.
;; Please replace it to the version name.

For example, if you want to put sources to c:/source
-----------------
c: [RETURN]
cd \source [RETURN]
tar zxvf Meadow-<VERSION>-src.tar.gz
-----------------

Then you can get the follwing source tree.

c:/source/Meadow-<VERSION>/-------src/      (Main source)
                               +--lib-src/  (library and tools source)
                               +--nt/       (configuration files for Meadow)
                               +--info/     (info files)
                               +--lisp/     (Emacs Lisp files)
                               +--etc/      (Other data)
                               +-- .... And so on

Your compilation environment(Microsoft Visual C++ or Cygwin) make the
following procedures different.

<STEP2: Compilation>

-----------------
cd Meadow-<VERSION>\nt [RETURN]
configure.meadow --with-msvc --prefix <YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY>[RETURN]
nmake bootstrap [RETURN]
nmake all [RETURN]
-----------------

You would be able to compile with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.x and 7.x.
I presume that you can do it with other version of Visual C++.
But I'm not sure.

If you meet any problem, you must resolve by YOURSELF!!! :-)

<STEP3: Installation>

-----------------
nmake install [RETURN]
-----------------

4.2 With Cygwin

<STEP1: Extract the archive>

Please extract the archive of Meadow in the same way as 4.1 STEP1.

<STEP2: Compilation>

On a Cygwin shell(sh, bash and so forth), you should type the
following command.

-----------------
cd Meadow-<VERSION>/nt [RETURN]
./configure.meadow.bat --with-gcc --no-cygwin --no-debug --prefix <YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY>[RETURN]
make bootstrap [RETURN]
make all [RETURN]
-----------------

You would be able to compile with cmd.exe (or command.com).
If you meet any problem, you must resolve by YOURSELF!!! :-)

<STEP3: Installation>

-----------------
make install [RETURN]
-----------------

5. Auxiliary programs

5.1 fakecygpty

Meadow 3.XX can run cygwin commands needs pseudo terminal more
naturally using fakecygpty as a wrapper program. This can be compiled
only with cygwin gcc. You can compile it just as follows, and put the
binary yielded into <YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY>/bin directory.

-----------------
cd nt
gcc -o fakecygpty.exe fakecygpty.c
cp fakecygpty.exe <YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY>/bin/
-----------------

 You can see how to use this program in the help of the variable
mw32-process-wrapper-alist. Typical setting of the variable is
following. You can put it into your .emacs file.

-----------------
(setq mw32-process-wrapper-alist
      '(("/\\(bash\\|tcsh\\|svn\\|ssh\\|gpg[esvk]?\\)\\.exe" .
	 (nil . "fakecygpty.exe"))))
-----------------

That's all.
