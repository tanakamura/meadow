Tasks needed before the next release.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.

These don't need to be fixed before a release, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

* BUGS WAITING FOR MORE USER INPUT

** undefined reference getopt_long
Report by Daniel C. Bastos <dbast0s@yahoo.com.br> on bug-gnu-emacs
from 2007-08-27.  Impossible to procede without more input from OP (as
of 20070912, emails are bouncing) or someone else who can reproduce this.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2007-08/msg01497.html

** emacs-22.1 with GTK problems (with patches)
Only outstanding issue seems to be whether Solaris 2.6 GTK can be
supported in the absence of recursive mutexes, via a change to
alloc.c, or whether configure should abort.
